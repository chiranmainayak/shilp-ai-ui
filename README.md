## 📌 What is Shilp-AI?

**Shilp-AI** is an autonomous **"Virtual Business Manager"** designed specifically for traditional Indian artisans, handloom weavers, potters, and rural micro-entrepreneurs. 

India is home to over 7 million traditional artisans producing exquisite handicrafts (Banarasi silk, Terracotta, Madhubani art, Dhokra brass, Blue Pottery, etc.). However, they face significant barriers in reaching modern e-commerce markets:
1. **Low Digital Literacy & Language Barriers**: Rural artisans often cannot navigate complicated, English-centric e-commerce seller portals.
2. **Poor Product Photography**: Photos taken inside dimly-lit, cluttered village workshops (showing walls, beds, clothes, shadows) get rejected by major e-commerce platforms.
3. **Exploitative Middlemen**: Lacking market visibility, artisans frequently sell authentic handmade heritage items for a fraction of their worth to brokers and middlemen.

**Shilp-AI solves this end-to-end**: An artisan simply snaps a photo and speaks into their phone in their mother tongue (Hindi, English, etc.). The AI automatically enhances the photograph into a studio-grade e-commerce listing, extracts craft details, calculates fair-wage pricing, and publishes the product to global buyers and B2B marketplaces.

## 🖼️ Before & After Photographic Enhancement (100% Authentic Product)

The core principle of Shilp-AI's Computer Vision studio is **Photo Editing Only — Zero Regeneration**:

> **"The product remains 100% identical to the real physical craft — same saree, exact colors, patterns, embroidery, texture, folds, shape, size, and position. We never regenerate, redraw, recolor, or distort the artisan's genuine work."**

| 📷 Before (Original Workshop Photo) | ✨ After (Professional Studio Edit) |
| :---: | :---: |
| <img src="public/crafts/saree_raw_photo.png" width="320" alt="Original Workshop Photo" /> | <img src="public/crafts/saree_enhanced_studio.png" width="320" alt="Professional Studio Edit" /> |
| *Dim room, cluttered bed, dark wardrobe, murky shadows* | *100% identical saree, clean studio backdrop, lifted exposure & zari radiance* |

### The 5 E-Commerce Quality Standards Met:
1. ✂️ **Background Removal (बैकग्राउंड हटाना)**: The entire cluttered room (walls, bed, clothes, floor, shadows) is removed cleanly without punching holes through the saree or leaving white patches.
2. ☀️ **Better Lighting (बेहतर लाइटिंग)**: Auto-levels dynamic range stretch brings out hidden folds and gold zari luster without blowing out highlights.
3. 🎨 **Natural Color Correction (प्राकृतिक रंग सुधार)**: Authentic silk dye (magenta-purple) and metallic gold zari luster are preserved naturally without artificial tinting or color shifts.
4. 📐 **Proper Positioning & Cropping (उचित स्थिति व क्रॉपिंग)**: Centered and straightened on standard square e-commerce framing with soft ground depth.
5. ✨ **Enhanced Quality (संवर्धित गुणवत्ता)**: Unsharp mask edge sharpening highlights intricate weave threads and embroidery with reduced sensor noise.

## ✨ Key Features & Modules

### 1. 📸 AI Computer Vision Studio & Live Sliders
* **Topological BFS & Neural Segmentation**: Combines in-browser WebAssembly neural segmentation (`@imgly/background-removal`) with a fallback Saliency BFS contour engine and morphological hole-closing to eliminate background clutter without internal white patches.
* **Interactive Fine-Tuning Sliders**:
  * ☀️ **Brightness** (`-30%` to `+50%`): Lift shadows with highlight protection.
  * 🌓 **Contrast** (`-20%` to `+50%`): S-curve contrast for deep folds and crisp details.
  * 🎨 **Saturation / Vibrance** (`-20%` to `+50%`): Enrich natural vegetable and mineral dyes.
  * **✨ Reset to AI Optimal**: 1-click restore to AI-recommended photographic settings.
* **15ms Instant Response**: In-memory cutout segmentation caching enables instant real-time slider feedback without re-segmenting.
* **Interactive Comparison Views**: Toggle between **Showcase View** (with the 5 Badges) and **Split Slider View** (interactive draggable divider).

### 2. 🎙️ Multilingual Voice-First Cataloging
* **Zero Form Typing**: Artisans simply speak into their microphone in **Hindi** or **English**:
  > *"यह बनारसी रेशम की साड़ी है। 5 दिन लगे और ₹2,500 कच्चा माल लगा।"*  
  > *(Or: "This is a handwoven Banarasi silk saree. It took me 5 days to make with 2500 rupees in raw materials.")*
* **Automatic NLP Attribute Extraction**: Identifies craft category, materials used, production days, raw cost, and verified **Geographical Indication (GI Tag)** heritage identifiers.
* **Bilingual Storytelling**: Generates evocative cultural storytelling in Hindi and SEO-optimized listings in English.
* **Spoken Audio Feedback**: The AI Copilot speaks back with voice confirmation via Web SpeechSynthesis.

---

### 3. ⚖️ Fair Value Pricing Engine (Guaranteed Living Wage)
* **Living Daily Wage Standard**: Integrates verified daily wage baselines (₹750 – ₹950/day based on skill and state guidelines).
* **Transparent Cost Breakdown**:
  $$\text{Fair Retail Price} = (\text{Raw Material Cost} \times 1.15) + (\text{Labor Days} \times \text{Daily Wage}) + \text{Heritage Artisan Margin}$$
* **GI Craft Heritage Multiplier**: Adds a 1.15x to 1.35x premium for certified authentic heritage crafts.
* **Wholesale Volume Tiers**:
  * Retail (1–9 units): Base Fair Price
  * Wholesale Bulk (10–49 units): 18% discount
  * Institutional / Export (50+ units): 28% discount
* **Interactive Sliders**: Artisans can adjust material costs and craft days to see their transparent labor earnings and margin breakdown.

### 4. 🏛️ Artisan Management Dashboard
* **MoSJE Beneficiary Card**: Displays verified artisan registration, GI craft badge, and artisan location.
* **5 Quick Action Tiles**:
  * 🎙️ *Voice Auto-Cataloger (आवाज से उत्पाद जोड़ें)*
  * 📸 *AI Image Studio (फोटो स्टूडियो संवर्धन)*
  * ⚖️ *Fair Pricing Calculator (उचित मूल्य कैलकुलेटर)*
  * 🤖 *AI Copilot Advisor (एआई सहायक से पूछें)*
  * 💬 *Buyer Inquiries & Quotes (थोक खरीदार पूछताछ)*
* **Business Analytics**: Track total listed crafts, completed orders, pending RFQ quotes, and monthly earnings.
* **Inventory Health & Reorder Alerts**: Automatic alerts for low-stock crafts and reorder planning.

---

### 5. 🛍️ Global Buyer Marketplace & Sourcing Portal
* **GI Heritage Filter & State Exploration**: Filter authentic Indian crafts by state (Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Odisha, Rajasthan, Telangana, etc.) and craft type (Textiles, Pottery, Metalwork, Woodcraft).
* **3-Way Photographic Inspection**:
  * `[ ✨ AI Enhanced ]`: Studio-grade clean listing photo.
  * `[ ▥ Before / After ]`: Verified side-by-side comparison showing background removal and lighting correction.
  * `[ 📷 Original ]`: Raw photo taken in the artisan's workshop for complete transparency.
* **Direct Artisan Chat**: Real-time messaging between buyers and artisans with translation support.
* **B2B Bulk RFQ (Request For Quote)**: Institutional buyers can request custom samples, volume quotes, and delivery timelines directly from the artisan.
